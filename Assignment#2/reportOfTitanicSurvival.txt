Survival rates grouped y Gender and age show that Women and Children
                had more survival rate than Men and Adults and Senior. This proves the fact that evacuation
                of Women and Children was given more priority than any other.
Passengers in 1st Class had much more higher survival rates than those in 2nd 
                and 3rd class. When using fare-based quantile bins, Survival rates also increase 
                with increase in higher fares. This confirms wealth was strongly related to survival chances
